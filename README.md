# elixir-vamp-technical-challenge

This full-stack application was crafted to tackle the learning curve of Elixir, GraphQL, and other new technologies I faced during my time at Vamp.

The backend, housed in the /vampapi folder, is built with Elixir and utilizes the Phoenix framework along with GraphQL instead of REST. It seamlessly connects to a Postgres Database for data storage.

On the frontend side, React.js powers the user interface, residing in the /frontend folder.

Instructions for launching both the frontend and backend are neatly detailed in the respective directories' ReadMe files.
