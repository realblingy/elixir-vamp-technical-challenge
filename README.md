# elixir-vamp-technical-challenge

This full stack application was written to unblock the challenge of writing and understanding Elixir, GraphQL and any other unfamiliar technologies I encountered while working at Vamp. 

The backend is written in Elixir and uses Phoenix framework utilising the GraphQL framework, not REST. This is stored in the /vampapi folder.

It is connected to a Postgres Database for persistent storage. 

The frontend is written in React.js. This is stored in the /frontend folder

The steps to launch the frontend and backend are contained within the ReadMe's of each directory.
